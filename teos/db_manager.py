    The :class:`DBManager` is the class in charge of interacting with the appointments database (``LevelDB``).
    Keys and values are stored as bytes in the database but processed as strings by the manager.

    The database is split in six prefixes:

        - ``WATCHER_PREFIX``, defined as ``b'w``, is used to store :obj:`Watcher <teos.watcher.Watcher>` appointments.
        - ``RESPONDER_PREFIX``, defines as ``b'r``, is used to store :obj:`Responder <teos.responder.Responder>` trackers.
        - ``WATCHER_LAST_BLOCK_KEY``, defined as ``b'bw``, is used to store the last block hash known by the :obj:`Watcher <teos.watcher.Watcher>`.
        - ``RESPONDER_LAST_BLOCK_KEY``, defined as ``b'br``, is used to store the last block hash known by the :obj:`Responder <teos.responder.Responder>`.
        - ``LOCATOR_MAP_PREFIX``, defined as ``b'm``, is used to store the ``locator:uuid`` maps.
        - ``TRIGGERED_APPOINTMENTS_PREFIX``, defined as ``b'ta``, is used to stored triggered appointments (appointments that have been handed to the :obj:`Responder <teos.responder.Responder>`.)
